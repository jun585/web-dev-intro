# âœ¨ Getting started with web dev - building your first portfolio

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ So you want to learn web development, but don't know where to start? Worry not, we are here to guide you through the practicalities of web dev by teaching you the fundamentals of HTML/CSS!

Being comfortable with the fundamentals will allow you to pick up popular front-end frameworks (e.g. React, Angular, Vue) with more ease. You will come out of this workshop with a portfolio which you can further enhance to showcase your skills to recruiters or future employers!

## Pre-workshop checklist
- [ ] **A text editor** to write code: there are many options out there, we recommend **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** as it has some good extensions that would make your coding experience a lot better. _Setting up VS Code is a breeze, see our instructions below_
- [ ] **A web browser**, to test code in. (e.g. **Chrome - Recommended**, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.)

#### Optional (but highly recommended) VS Code Setup
Below are the steps for setting up our recommended text editor, VS Code, along with a few extensions that we think would be useful! 
_:clock1: Estimated setup time: 5-7 minutes_
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension - this will enable instant browser reload with changes to your code, without you having to hit save to see your changes on the browser.
3. Install the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) extension - this will allow you to share your code with us if you ever need help :)
    - Note that for this extension, you will need either a [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-ie) account to login to begin any Live Share sessions.
4. Install [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) so that your HTML/CSS code can be automatically formatted.

## We have split the project into four parts

1. [Creating `index.html`](part-1/README.md)
2. [Designing & building a wireframe](part-2/README.md)
3. [Adding CSS & implementing responsive web design](part-3/README.md)
4. [Adding advanced styling](part-4/README.md)

## ðŸŒŒ The finished product

Your finished portfolio will look similar to this, with minor differences in content
